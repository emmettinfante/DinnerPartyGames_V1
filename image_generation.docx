To blend well with your current color theme (#EDF8F0 background), hereâ€™s what to aim for in the image:

Target Area	Recommended Look
Lighting	Soft natural daylight, slightly cool or desaturated tones (not overly warm/yellow)
Backdrop	Light backgrounds like mint, white, beige, light gray, or natural wood
Outfits	Neutrals or slightly muted versions of your site accents: sage green, soft yellow, sky blue, coral red (aligned with #00BF63, #FFDE59, #0CC0DF, #FF3131)
Props/Game	Cards, table, drinksâ€”avoid clutter; keep tabletop bright or lightly colored
Filter Option	Slight mint-tinted overlay (#EDF8F0 at ~10-20% opacity) for harmony

ðŸ§  Pro Tip: Reduce Saturation or Add a Blur Background

If your photo has a lot of bright red or blue, reduce saturation slightly or use a CSS backdrop-filter: blur(6px) + a tinted overlay to stay minimalist.
